## SECTION 2: THE GAP

### Direction Notes:

- Subtle background color shift
- Conversational, warm tone

### Copy:

**Section Header:**
Why we're building this

**Body:**
If you've navigated limb loss, you know how fragmented everything is. Products are scattered across outdated websites. Useful information is buried in forum threads or locked behind medical jargon. Finding a provider who actually specializes in this takes hours of research and cold calls.

Meanwhile, your family and friends want to help but aren't sure where to start or what to ask.

We think there should be one place that brings it all together, built by people who understand what you're actually dealing with.

## SECTION 3: THE FOUR PILLARS

### Direction Notes:
- Four cards in a grid (2x2 desktop, stacked mobile)
- Each card: icon, headline, short paragraph, "Coming Soon" badge
- Include a mid-page CTA after the cards

---

### Pillar 1: Marketplace

**Headline:**
Products that make daily life easier

**Body:**
Liners, sleeves, socks, skincare, and other essentials, all in one place. No more hunting across multiple stores or wondering if something is actually worth buying. We'll curate products based on what actually works, with input from people who use them.

**Badge:** Coming Soon

---

### Pillar 2: Resources

**Headline:**
Information you can actually use

**Body:**
Recovery timelines, product comparisons, guides for different stages of the journey. We're building a library of resources that's organized, searchable, and written in plain language. The kind of information you wish existed when you first started looking.

**Badge:** Coming Soon

### Pillar 3: Telehealth

**Headline:**
Providers who specialize in limb loss

**Body:**
Find prosthetists, physiatrists, physical therapists, and mental health professionals who work specifically with people in your situation. Read about their background, see their availability, and book directly. No more guessing whether someone will actually understand your needs.

**Badge:** Coming Soon

---

### Pillar 4: AI Support

**Headline:**
A place to ask questions anytime

**Body:**
Sometimes you have a question at midnight, or you want to think through options before talking to a provider. Our AI assistant is trained specifically on limb loss topics and designed to be helpful without overstepping into medical advice.

**Badge:** Coming Soon

---

### Mid-Page CTA

**Copy:**

## SECTION 4: WHO THIS IS FOR

### Direction Notes:
- Three columns on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Each column: small icon or illustration, headline, paragraph
- Warm, inclusive

---

### Column 1: For people with limb loss

**Body:**
Whether you're preparing for surgery, early in recovery, or years into living with a prosthetic, this platform is designed around what you actually need day to day. We're building it with input from people who've been through it.

---

### Column 2: For family members

**Body:**
When someone you love is going through this, it's hard to know how to help. We want to give you a place to learn what they're dealing with, understand the terminology, and find ways to actually be useful.

---

### Column 3: For friends who want to support

**Body:**
It can feel awkward to ask questions when you don't know what's appropriate. This gives you a starting point to learn and understand, so you can show up for someone without making them explain everything.

## SECTION 5: CREDIBILITY

### Direction Notes:
- Photo of Alex (if going personal) or skip photo (if faceless)
- Keep it simple and genuine

---

### Option A: Personal (Recommended for network launch)

**Headline:**
Who's behind this

**Body:**
I'm Alex Meyers, and I've worked in prosthetics for over a decade. I've seen firsthand how hard it is for people to find what they need, and how often the resources that do exist are outdated or hard to navigate.

This platform is my attempt to build what I think should already exist. If you have thoughts, questions, or want to get involved, I'd genuinely love to hear from you.

---

### Option B: Collective (If Alex prefers not to be named)

**Headline:**
Who's behind this

**Body:**
We're a team with decades of combined experience in prosthetic care. We've worked directly with patients, families, and providers, and we've seen the same gaps over and over. This platform is our attempt to close them.

# NOTES

**What changed from V1:**

1. Removed all staccato fragment sentences ("This. That. Real.")
2. Wrote in complete, natural prose throughout
3. Dropped the manufactured emotional drama
4. Kept sentences flowing and conversational
5. Removed forced "punchy" endings
6. Made it sound like a real person explaining something they care about, not a copywriter performing authenticity

**Still hitting the strategic goals:**

- Clear value proposition in hero
- Emotional arc still exists (gap → solution → invitation) but delivered through natural language
- Multiple CTAs at key points
- Expands audience to family/friends
- Ends on warm, inviting note
- CTA clarity on what happens next

**AI tells still avoided:**

- No em dashes
- No rhetorical questions
- No "isn't just X, it's Y" framing
- No unsourced claims
- No triplet flourishes
